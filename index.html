                <p>Doctor Who is one of the most iconic science fiction shows of all time. Especially in the UK. It is also the longest running show in the UK. The first episode aired on <b>Novemer 23rd, 1963!</b> It has had its ups and downs and taken a break for a few years but since 2005 it has been going stronger than ever. Most Whovians (as Who fans refer to themselves) consider 2005 to be the line between the era of the old and the era of the new Doctor. But with over 850 episodes (131 since 2005) it seems daunting to start watching the series. Not to worry! I'm here to give you three of the best episodes for newbies!! Doctor Who is mainly an anthology with somewhat of a loose theme each season. However, the episodes I will be referring to are stand alone.</p>

                <h2 class="bold">Basic Things You Need To Know About Doctor Who</h2>
                <p>“Doctor Who” is the story of an alien <span class="bold">calling</span> himself the Doctor (not his real name, of course, but that’s the title he’s chosen for himself). His race, the Time Lords, have mastered time travel, but have a strict non-interference policy in order to avoid messing with the space-time continuum. The Doctor has chosen to break that rule, so he steals a time machine he dubs the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimensions in Space) and decides to explore the universe. Very early on, however, his TARDIS malfunctions and, while originally designed to blend in with its surroundings, becomes permanently stuck as a police box from 1960s England. It also starts taking the Doctor to places where he is needed instead of to places where he actually wants to go – settings where oppression is rampant, or a group of people are under attack, or there’s some kind of larger mystery that needs solving. These places can be anywhere in time and space – near-future Moon, ancient Rome, present-day London or a futuristic spaceship. With a few exceptions, most episodes take place in entirely different settings. The Doctor is absolutely brilliant, with an intellect usually far superior to those around him and with a vast knowledge of the Universe, but the fact that he had to wipe out the entire race of the Time Lords in between “Classic Who” and “New Who” has forced him to become a pacifist, swearing that he could never harm anyone else like that again. To keep his morals in check, the Doctor often travels with a companion, who (in New Who) is almost always a young British woman. His companions change every once in a while, but so does the Doctor – when mortally wounded, he can “regenerate”, healing his injuries but also gaining an entirely new body and personality. In “New Who” he has been played by 5 different actors (well, 6, depending on how you’re counting – it’s a long story), and overall her (The Doctor regenerated into a woman for the first time, in the show at least) current incarnation is number 13 – this has allowed the show to go on for so long. What makes “Doctor Who” unique from all other sci-fi shows is that the Doctor never uses any weapons and never harms his opponents if he can avoid it – he relies on his wit and his trusty sonic screwdriver (a multifunctional instrument that can open locks, hack computers and do a million other things… as long as you don’t use it on wood) to get him out of any dangerous situations.</p>

                <h2>1. Blink</h2>
                <p><i><b>"Blink and you're dead. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And DON'T BLINK."</b></i></p>

                <p>One of the scariest villains in the entire series was introduced in this episode. The weeping angels. The above cryptic message was left within an Easter Egg of on 17 DVD's by The Doctor and Martha Jones (his companion of the time). These messages lead Sally Sparrow on an adventure she could never have dreamed of. Full of scary music and mystery and terrifying monsters this is my all time favorite stand alone episode. It's a great place to start because you need to know almost nothing about the Doctor Who universe.</p>
                
                <h2>2. The Girl in the Fireplace</h2>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>This episode is one of those that gives you all the feels. The Doctor and companions (Rose and Mickey) land on a spaceship in the 51st centery that is seemingly abandoned. But what they do find on board is a time portal to 18th century Versailles. It is connected to the fireplace of a young girl (who we later find out will grow up to be Madame de Pompadour-played by Sophia Myles) In this adventure The Doctor must enter Versaille save Madame De Pompadour. But his hearts (yes, he has two) get involved. Prepare for this emotional roller coaster, for us and The Doctor.</p>

                <h2 id="last-h2">3. The Doctor's Wife</h2>

                <br>
                <p>The Doctor's Wife is an episode that is near and dear to my heart because it has a little bit of everything. It's full of witty British humor, scary villains, and a lot of the feels! The Doctor follows a Time Lord distress signal out of the Universe only to discover it's a trap and that both he and the TARDIS are in grave danger. What makes this so great is that the TARDIS must make herself a human shell in order to get out of this dire situation. The dynamic between the two is absolutely perfect. The Doctor is finally matched in intellect and what ensues is both hilarious and very touching.</p>
